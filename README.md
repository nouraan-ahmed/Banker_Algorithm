# Banker_algorithm
The bankerâ€™s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety . In This project I implemented the algorithm using c++ and the implementation mainly depends on two dimentional vectors. The inputs are: number of processes,number of resources,alloation matrix,max matrix,available matrix,user can enquiry safe state,user can enquiry immediate request . The outputs are: need matrix,answer if the system is in safe state (and print sequence) or not , answer if the resource can be allocated to the process (and print sequence) or not .
